# Radial Calendar

Continuing the theme of [calendars](/blog/2022/calendar-generator.md),
I've made a radial calendar. It's the way I imagine a year in my head:
a circle with 12 months, new year starts at the top,
and the months are numbered clockwise.

I made it with [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), which is a great library for visualising data.
