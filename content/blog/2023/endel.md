# Endel

![Endel](endel.png "")

Endel is an app that makes "soundscapes" â€“ not exactly music,
but not exactly noise either. It's a mix of sounds tailored to help you sleep, relax, focus, etc.

I've been using it for more than a year now, and it really helped me with my sleep.

Use my code to get a one month free trial (no card needed), then it's a yearly subscription.

There are also some free presets available on popular streaming services:
