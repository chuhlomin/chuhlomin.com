# Raycast

![Raycast](raycast.png)

Raycast is an extendable launcher, a great alternative to Alfred, Spotlight, and other launchers.

https://www.raycast.com

I been an Alfred user for years, but I switched to Raycast for the following reasons.

- [Clipboard history](https://manual.raycast.com/core), syncs across devices, for free.
- [Upcoming meetings](https://manual.raycast.com/calendar) in the menu bar, join with a click.
- [Snippets](https://manual.raycast.com/snippets). You may configure it so if you type `{ts}` enywhere, it will be replaced with the current timestamp. Also see [ray.so/snippets](https://ray.so/snippets).
- Floating Notes that stays on top of all windows and is great for writing down daily todos, drafting a tweet, or jot down meeting notes.
- [Control system settings](https://manual.raycast.com/system), like system appearance, volume, and more.
- [Window management](https://manual.raycast.com/window-management), like moving windows to left or right half of the screen.

Give it a try and walk through the tutorial. It's a great app.
