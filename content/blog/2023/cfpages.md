# Cloudflare Pages

![Cloudflare Pages](cfpages.png "Cloudflare Pages")

Cloudflare is a content delivery network (CDN) and a domain name registrar.

[Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com) is a JAMstack platform â€“
a service for hosting static websites and serverless functions.

It is free, but your website cannot be larger than 25 MB or have more
than 20,000 files.

https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/limits/

It also provides a built-in continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD)
that automatically deploys new changes whenever updates are pushed
to a connected git repository.

Since recently, my [homepage](https://github.com/chuhlomin/homepage)
is hosted on Cloudflare Pages.
