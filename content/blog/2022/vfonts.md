# Variable fonts

Typically, fonts come in a variety of styles,
different combinations of widths and weights (e.g., Condensed, Narrow, Standard, Wide)
и веса (e.g., Light, Book, Regular, Bold).

In 2016, Microsoft added "variable fonts" to the OpenType 1.8 specification.
These fonts allow for more fine-tuning of the various font parameters:
weight, width, slant, optical size,
or any other parameter of a particular font.
