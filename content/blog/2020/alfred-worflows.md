# Alfred Workflows

Alfred goodies.

There is a public site called Packal where people exchange themes and workflows for Alfred. If you think of creating any new workflow, check there, likely someone already made it.  
http://www.packal.org

I have also recently come across an excellent collection by Vítor Galvão:

By the way, the same guy also sells on beautiful abstract prints on Society6:

But back to our workflows. Recently I've been itching to make such a workflow that would prepare the computer for a presentation/screen recording:

- turn off notifications,
- hide icons on the desktop,
- turn on auto-hide for the Dock,
- turn on auto-hide for the menubar,
- close applications, like Telegram,
- open KeyCastr
- and reset everything to its original state when you're done. 

Here's the result:
