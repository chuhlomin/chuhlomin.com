# Monaco Editor

![Monaco Editor](monaco.png "Monaco Editor")

Now my main editor in which I write code in VSCode.
I recently found out that Microsoft provides JS library Monaco Editor â€“ a "trimmed" version of VSCode, only editor with mini-map, highlighting, and many other little things.

Perfect if you make an online code editor or if you need to show the difference between two JSONs with highlighting. I can recommend it to those who have used Code Mirror before: https://codemirror.net

#vscode #js
