If your job involves regular online calls, you probably know the annoyance that comes up when you need to quickly find a link to a meeting in your mail or calendar, you click it, perhaps a new browser tab opens that says "application opens...".

Three students from Europe (+co-founder) made a Meeter app that:

* hangs in the bar menu (when you click on the icon, it shows meetings for the day)
* shows a countdown to the next meeting,
* sends notifications when a meeting starts with a simple "Join" button,
* works with Zoom, Google Meet, Teams, and more.

To make it all work, the app asks for access to the calendar.
But deny access to contacts â€“ you don't need them for the app to function (as the app itself reports).

"For now," it's free.
