# Timestamp

As I mentioned in my [post about Alfred](alfred.md), I like to put timestamps in my texts. They somehow add context. For example, when debugging something, I write down my thoughts and attempts step by step so that if I get interrupted, I can quickly retrace my steps.

It takes a long time to enter these labels manually, so on the Mac, I use a keyboard shortcut to do this.

And on the iPhone with iOS 14, you can now do such a thing: set the script execution (Siri Shortcut) on a double/triple tap on the back of the phone (Settings / Accessibility / Touch / Back Tap). The Shortcut receives the current date and copies it to the clipboard. All that remains is to paste the date into the note manually.
