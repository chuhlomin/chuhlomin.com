# GitHub Satellite

![GitHub Satellite Logo](github-satellite.png)

This Wednesday there was an online conference called "GitHub Satellite."
https://githubsatellite.com

https://github.blog/2020-05-06-new-from-satellite-2020-github-codespaces-github-discussions-securing-code-in-private-repositories-and-more

Of the several interesting new features stand out:

‚Ä¢ Codespaces ‚Äì ¬´get the full Visual Studio Code experience without leaving GitHub¬ª.
It was quite expected: Microsoft owns both GitHub and VSCode.
Now I'm waiting for GitHub and Azure to merge somehow, so we can run projects without leaving GitHub - Actions is already thereüçø.

‚Ä¢ Discussions ‚Äì for discussions that don't fall into the "issues" and "pr" category, a kind of Stack Overflow for questions and answers at the project level.

‚Ä¢ Code scanning alerts ‚Äì code vulnerability scanner (kind of a result of the Semmle acquisition)

‚Ä¢ Secret scanning is now available for private repositories.
