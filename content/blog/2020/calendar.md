# Calendar 2020

In the current situation, when the days behind the window imperceptibly change, it is essential to maintain a sense of time.
For me, it is much more relaxing to see a calendar in front of my eyes.
After looking for several options, I found a nice calendar by Art. Lebedev Studio:

I don't remember exactly why I didn't order it. My hands itched, and I made my version.
