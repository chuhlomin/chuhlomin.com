# CCMenu

There was a continuous integration (CI) tool â€“ CruiseControl (2001-2010).
Written by ThoughtWorks, the BSD-licensed open-source project got a lot of publicity.
http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net

They came up with the CCTray format, which has become the de facto standard for describing the status of projects in CI systems:
https://cctray.org/v1/

Travis, Jenkins, TeamCity, Drone CI, and many others provide special URLs where they give information about the status of builds, for example:
https://ci.chuhlomin.com/api/badges/chuhlomin/timestamp/cc.xml  
In Drone CI, that understandably only works for public projects.

Another side of the matter is to make this information available to the user in a convenient form.
On macOS, a program called CCMenu does this (see screenshot).
