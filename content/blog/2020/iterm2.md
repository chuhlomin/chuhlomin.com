# iTerm2

If you spend a lot of time in the terminal on macOS, you probably use iTerm2 — a full-fledged replacement for the system Terminal with a bunch of features:

I've been using it for years, but just recently discovered that with a couple of clicks you can do what I manually set up for myself and everyone around me: Natural Text Editing (see video and screenshot).

The point is that instead of the classic combinations like
"<kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd>", "<kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd>",
"<kbd>Esc</kbd>, <kbd>b</kbd>", "<kbd>Esc</kbd>, <kbd>f</kbd>"
you can use intuitive and memorable combinations from text editors:
"<kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>←</kbd>", "<kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>→</kbd>",
"<kbd>⌥</kbd>+<kbd>←</kbd>", "<kbd>⌥</kbd>+<kbd>→</kbd>".
