# Gource

In 2009, Andrew Caudwell started the Gource project (GPL 3.0), an application for visualizing changes in a project based on version control system data (Git, Mercurial, SVN).

Gource shows the project repository as an animated tree, with the root directory in the center.
Dots represent individual files and sub-directories. Authors appear and disappear as they make changes.

Support for Gravatar (a database of avatars associated with an email address) looks interesting.
