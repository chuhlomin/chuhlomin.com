# WebP

In 2010, Google announced a new image format, WebP (read "weppy").

More effective than JPEGs, PNGs, and GIFs, YouTube is using it to show YouTube video previews, which speeded up page loading by 10%:

So far, it's natively supported in Google Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and a few other browsers except Safari.

You can convert images to and from WebP format using the libweb library or the webp and dwebp CLI tools.

By the way, Telegram transmits regular stickers in this format.
