# Mail Merge

![Mail Merge](mail-merge_og.png)

Apple Pages has a built-in Mail Merge feature.
Despite the name, it's not related to the Mail app at all.
Instead, it, acts as a powerful templating tool that allows you to create personalized documents in bulk with incredible ease.
You can find it at the end of the "Document" panel in Pages.

Here's how it works:
First, you create a table in Numbers where each column represents a field (e.g., Name, Address) and each row corresponds to a different document.
In Pages, set up a link to the table, use the available “fields”, click Mail Merge, and voila - Pages will create a new document with copies of your template with the data from the table.

This feature is a lifesaver when you need to fill out multiple forms that are similar but not identical data-wise.
