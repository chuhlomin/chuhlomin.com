# Central Park

![Central Park promo](central-park.png "Central Park promo")

Central Park, an unexpectedly good family-friendly animated sitcom-musical, is available on Apple TV+.

The main plot is based on the confrontation between the family of the park manager (who lives in a house on the park grounds) and a devious developer who wants to build up New York's largest park.

Also, I'd like to highlight the narrator, a street musician who often breaks the fourth wall.

The music here is used to reveal the characters and move the plot along; you can appreciate it on Spotify (watch out for spoilers):

10 episodes of 20-30 minutes, with only half a season out so far.
