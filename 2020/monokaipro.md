# Monokai Pro

![Monokai Pro logo](monokaipro.png "Monokai Pro logo")

An aesthetically pleasing dark color scheme for VSCode and Sublime.  
You can try it for free, but to remove the popup you have to pay â‚¬9.95. The theme comes in six variants (https://monokai.pro/vscode) and includes 50+ icons for files.

There are also free analogues for other editors/IDE with the same name, e.g.
https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13643-monokai-pro.
