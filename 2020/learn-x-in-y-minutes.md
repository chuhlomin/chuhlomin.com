# Learn X in Y minutes

![Learn X in Y minutes promo](learn-x-in-y-minutes.png "Learn X in Y minutes promo")

Adam Bard from Canada in 2013 made a project "Learn X in Y minutes" â€“ a website with short tutorials on different programming languages for programmers to quickly learn a new language.

https://learnxinyminutes.com

At the end of the articles, as a general rule, there are links to additional materials.
Many articles are translated into several languages, and 1466 people have already joined the project.

I found the project very useful several times already, I warmly recommend it.
