# Notes

![Notes screenshot](notes.png "Notes screenshot")

It seems to me that many people undeservedly overlook the Notes app.
Yes, it doesn't have the uncountable features that its competitors have, but maybe most users don't need them?

I've been using Notes for many years now, and this is my advice:

- use hotkeys - using them makes using any application more pleasant, faster,
- use Emoji (⌃⌘Space) where acceptable,
- set the settings to start "notes with headers,"
- put the date and time at the beginning of each note, and as you write it (see my first post about #alfred),
- pin important notes.

You can also set up hotkeys for any menu items:
