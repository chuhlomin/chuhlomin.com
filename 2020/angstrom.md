# Ångström

![Ångström promo](angstrom.png "Ångström promo")

Angstrom is a unit of measure equal to 10-¹⁰ meters, as well as the name of another iOS app that has moved to my main screen, Ångström (from Alexander Babaev and Ilya Birman).

"Converts units and currencies faster than you type":

My most common use cases: to convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius, miles to kilometers, and time zones.
Although the search bar "knows" about the same thing, it's much nicer to do it in the app.
