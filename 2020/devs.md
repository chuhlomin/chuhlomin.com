Devs (Hulu, FX), a sci-fi thriller mini-series that explores issues of free will and determinism, was released in late March of this year. The finished story tells the story of engineer Lily Chan. In the not-too-distant future, she investigates the disappearance of her boyfriend after his first day at work in Amaya Corporation's new department, Devs. What this department does, only a few people know, and is kept in secret.

Eight episodes â‰ˆ 50 minutes each

The series may seem slow due to the long scenes and long pauses in the dialogues, but I enjoyed both the picture and the acting.
Nick Offerman plays one of the leading roles, which you may know from the 45-minute clip of him just silently sitting by the fireplace and drinking whiskey: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS-ErOKpO4E.

The room where the "developers" work (in the promo on the right) refers to Menger sponge:
