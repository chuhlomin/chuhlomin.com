# Legion

![Legion promo](legion.jpeg "Legion promo")

I recommend Legion on Hulu (FX, Marvel Television, 2017) based on the comic books of the same name (I didn't read).

The main character, a "mutant" diagnosed with schizophrenia at an early age, is a telepath and can do many other things. It turns out there are a few more people in the world with unique abilities and a government organization opposing them. A kind of alternative X-Men. Often very strange and sometimes creepy and with a touch of the 1960s. Not without time travel.

1 episode â‰ˆ 45 minutes, almost an hour with commercials.  
Three seasons (27 episodes), beautifully started, beautifully ended.

Apple TV: https://tv.apple.com/us/show/legion/umc.cmc.1qs2k3j6y79dkp2muruy3tfgy

The soundtrack is also good: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2cKiAe5MITFQiLaTKEQIXV?si=FcVAngJUQGKi7kc6PR-xyQ
