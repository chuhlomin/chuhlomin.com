# iTerm2

If you spend a lot of time in the terminal on macOS, you probably use iTerm2 - a full-fledged replacement for the system Terminal with a bunch of features:

I've been using it for years, but just recently discovered that with a couple of clicks you can do what I manually set up for myself and everyone around me: Natural Text Editing (see video and screenshot).

The point is that instead of the classic combinations like "Control+A", "Control+E", "Esc, b", "Esc, f"
you can use intuitive and memorable combinations from text editors: "⌘+←", "⌘+→", "⌥+←", "⌥+→".
