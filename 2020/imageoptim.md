# ImageOptim

It's no secret that images have metadata: geolocation, the device from which the photo was taken, and so on (see EXIF, IPTC, and XMP). However, you don't always want to share this information when sending someone an e-mail, for example.

Recently I found a free ImageOptim, which removes all this data:
