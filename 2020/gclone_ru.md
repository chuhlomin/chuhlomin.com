# gclone

Presenting you the `gclone` script, which clones the repository to the folder
following convention `<owner>/<repo>` (like go get before introducing modules):

```bash
gclone git@github.com:chuhlomin/terraform.git
â†“
mkdir ~/Projects/chuhlomin
git clone git@github.com:chuhlomin/terraform.git ~/Projects/chuhlomin
```

One more thing to add is the `group_by_owner` script, which arranges existing repositories in the "right" places:
