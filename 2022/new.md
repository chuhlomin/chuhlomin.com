![.new](new.png ".new")

In 2018, Google registered several new domains, making it easier to create
documents, spreadsheets, presentations, and forms.
Just type these "shortcut" domains in the address bar and a new document is created.

* [doc.new](https://doc.new)
* [sheet.new](https://sheet.new)
* [slide.new](https://slide.new)
* [form.new](https://form.new)
* [drawing.new](https://drawing.new)

These ".new" domains exist for [many popular services](https://whats.new/shortcuts/),
such as Office 365:

* [word.new](https://word.new)
* [excel.new](https://excel.new)
* [ppt.new](https://ppt.new)

A few more examples:

* [repo.new](https://repo.new) (GitHub Repository)
* [gist.new](https://gist.new) (GitHub Gist)
* [figma.new](https://figma.new) (Figma)
* [notion.new](https://notion.new) (Notion)
