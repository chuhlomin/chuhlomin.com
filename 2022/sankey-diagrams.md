# Sankey Diagrams

In 1898, Irish captain Matthew Henry Phineas Riall Sankey
wrote an article about efficiency of a steam engine
in the Minutes of proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers.

He introduced a new type of diagram to represent the fluxes and energy losses in a steam engine, which is compared to an ideal steam engine.
The width of the stream is proportional to the amount of heat.

Diagrams of this type are named after Sankey and are widely used:
