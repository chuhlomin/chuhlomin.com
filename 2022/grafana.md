# Grafana

![Grafana](grafana.png "Grafana")

Grafana is an open-source app for visualizing and analyzing metrics.
It supports many data sources, including Prometheus, InfluxDB, and more.

From its release in 2014, it evolved into a much more powerful tool.
Now it can be used to:

* alert you when the metric is too high or too low via email, Slack, Telegram, PagerDuty, etc,
* browse logs from Loki, Elasticsearch, or CloudWatch,
* query distributed traces from Zipkin, Jaeger, or Tempo.
