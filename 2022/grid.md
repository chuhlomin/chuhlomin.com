# Grid

It's been itching to make some kind of PDF generator with patterns for a long time, and here we are:

https://grid.chuhlomin.com

![Grid site screenshot](grid_web.png "Grid site screenshot")

Set the parameters in the interface, click "Download" and get the file to print.

You can configure:

* paper size and page orientation
* pattern and its size
* line width and color

I especially fiddled with the version for the small screen.

All this was meant to draw [isometric maps](https://www.wistedt.net/tutorials/tutorial-isometric-dungeon-map/).

Print responsibly.
