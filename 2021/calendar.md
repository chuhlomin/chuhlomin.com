# 2021

Happy 2021!  
Statistically, this year should be better than the last. Seriously, it's hard to imagine that anything could top all the hell that's been going on all year.

The new year means a new calendar.  
This time, not drawn in Sketch, but generated by Go program.  
It helped me a lot in 2020 not to get lost in time.

Set goals and make plans! You probably won't reach all your goals, but you'll be a lot closer to them than if you hadn't planned.
